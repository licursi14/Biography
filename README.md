Bio
=====

My name is Luke Licursi. I am currently halfway through my second year at the University of Toronto. I am in the Engineering 
Science program and plan on specializing in physics after my second year. 

I am very interested in physics, astrophysics, and  and I believe that working with your lab over the summer will be an amazing 
opportunity for me to learn and absorb as much information as I can in your research field. 

Although I am only an undergraduate student I am very hard working and I love to learn new things. I am able to program in
Python, Matlab, C, Verilog, and Assembly. If you would like to see more of my past personal and academic work at this website:
